# Kubernetes LoadBalancer Solutions in On-Premise Environments

## üß© Problem

In cloud environments (like AWS, GCP, Azure), `LoadBalancer` Services in Kubernetes automatically provision an external IP via the cloud provider.

In **on-premise** environments, there is no built-in LoadBalancer. You must add this functionality manually using external tools.

---

## ‚úÖ Common Solutions

### üîπ MetalLB

- Adds LoadBalancer functionality to on-prem clusters.
- Assigns external IPs to Kubernetes Services.
- Works in two modes:
  - **Layer 2 (L2)**: Uses ARP to advertise IPs on the local network.
  - **BGP (Layer 3)**: Integrates with network routers via Border Gateway Protocol.

### üîπ Kube-VIP

- Provides a virtual IP (VIP) for the Kubernetes API server or LoadBalancer Services.
- Commonly used for **HA control plane setups**.
- Simple, does not require router configuration.

### üîπ Reverse Proxy (Traefik, NGINX, HAProxy) + NodePort

- Routes external traffic to NodePort Services.
- Acts as a custom LoadBalancer and Ingress.
- Offers additional features:
  - ‚úÖ TLS termination
  - ‚úÖ Caching
  - ‚úÖ Path-based routing
  - ‚úÖ Rate limiting
  - ‚úÖ Authentication
  - ‚úÖ Request rewriting & redirection

### üîπ MetalLB: L2 vs BGP

When deploying MetalLB in an on-premise Kubernetes cluster, you can choose between **Layer 2 (L2)** or **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** mode. Each mode has its own trade-offs in terms of simplicity, scalability, and network integration.

---

## üîπ Layer 2 (L2) Mode

**How it works:**
- Uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to advertise the service IP on the local network.
- One node responds to ARP requests for the LoadBalancer IP.

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Simple to set up
- ‚úÖ No need for external routers
- ‚úÖ Ideal for small, flat networks (single subnet)

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ùå Limited to a single Layer 2 broadcast domain
- ‚ùå Doesn't scale well across multiple racks, switches, or datacenters
- ‚ùå No control over routing ‚Äì relies on local broadcast

---

## üîπ BGP Mode

**How it works:**
- MetalLB speaks BGP with your physical router.
- Advertises LoadBalancer IPs directly via routing protocols.

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Scales across subnets, datacenters, and regions
- ‚úÖ Fully integrates with enterprise-grade networks
- ‚úÖ Fast, deterministic routing
- ‚úÖ Supports multi-path and failover setups

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ùå Requires access to and configuration of network routers
- ‚ùå Slightly more complex to set up (BGP peers, ASN, etc.)

| Feature                  | Layer 2 (L2)           | BGP                        |

| Requires Router Access   | No                     | Yes                         |
| Works Across Subnets     | No                     | Yes                         |

| Use Case                 | Labs, home, dev setups | Production, multi-site      |

## ‚úÖ Recommendation

- Use **L2** for small, single-subnet clusters or quick testing.
- Use **BGP** for production, multi-node, or cross-datacenter clusters where scalability and control are critical.

## üí° Production-Ready Stack

In production, the best approach is to **combine multiple tools**, each solving a different layer of networking:

| Tool        | Purpose                                      |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Kube-VIP**    | Virtual IP for HA control plane              |
| **MetalLB (BGP)** | External IPs for LoadBalancer Services     |
| **Traefik**      | Ingress + TLS + advanced routing & security |

---

## üß† Conclusion

For a secure and scalable on-prem setup:

- Use **Kube-VIP** for HA.
- Use **MetalLB in BGP mode** for LoadBalancer services.
- Use **Traefik** (or NGINX) for ingress, TLS, caching, and smart routing.

This combination ensures:
- High availability
- Flexible traffic control
- Production-grade performance
